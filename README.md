# Advanced Machine Learning Project (Fall 2024 - ENSAE Paris) - Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks

**Generative modeling** encompasses a class of machine learning techniques designed to capture the underlying distribution of a dataset, enabling the generation of new samples that closely resemble the original data. This constitutes an unsupervised learning problem that fundamentally consists—explicitly or implicitly—in min- imizing a divergence metric between the unknown true data distribution and the an estimated distribution to produce realistic samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ([Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), by capitalizing on the powerful representational capabilities of deep learning architectures, have represented one of the most significant machine learning breakthroughs in recent years. Yet, this method comes with drawbacks that justify the present project.

**Contributions**. Throughout this work, the various practical challenges inherent in training GANs will be empirically explored and theoretically justified. Building on the work of [Arkovsky et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) we will demonstrate how these challenges can be mitigated through Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), supported by rigorous theoretical justifications.
